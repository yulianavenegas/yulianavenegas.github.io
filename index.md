* Lab 2
    Lab 2, part 3 was one of my favorites because Hello World is a common first program for many beginer programmers due to its simple language. This is a useful exercise for learning the basic syntax and structure for  a new language, as well as getting a feel for how to write and run a program.

* Lab 6
    Lab 6, part 1 we learned how to use loops to create patterns of a symbol on the screen. Loops are a fundamental concept in programming that allow you to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. This can be useful for generating patterns, as well as many other tasks as processing large amount of data or running simulations.

* Lab 11
    Lab 11, part 2 I created a Hi-Lo guessing game, the player is presneted with a secret number that they must try to guess. The player is given a limited number of tries to guess, they are told whether their guess was too low or two high. If the player guesses the number correctly within the given number of tries, they win the game. If they run out of tries without guessing the number correctly, they lose the game.
